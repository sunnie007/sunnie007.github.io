      <p class="beer">
        I love that Miami's beer and food scene has changed in the last 7 years. Their are more food trucks, diffrent cuisines and new places opening everyday. Miami is becoming culturally more diverse.
      </p>
      <p class="kush"> 
        My 1st job when I returned back to Miami was Kush. Matt Kusher began this new concept in Wynwood. Beer focus with amazing bar bites.
      </p>
      <p>
        He revitlized a beer drinkers experience. Mirco brews from all over the world,and locally sourced ingredents for the food.I admire him, so if your ever in the Wynwood area check out Kush.
      </p>
      <p class="butcher">
       Butcher shop is another awesome spot. The Butcher shop is actually a meat market as well as resturant. You can order a great steak to eat in or take home.
      </p>

      <p class="butcher-shop">
        They have an amazing vartiey of foods and drinks. This location also has a wonderful selection of local craft beer and tasty cocktails. When strolling the neigborhood checking out street art. Stop in and check this place out, the beer garden is beautiful.

      <h2>
        Around the World
      </h2>

      <p class="passion">
        I traveled in my 20's, I've been all over the world. I stopped traveling in my 30's to presue my culinary passion. Now in my 40's I'm enjoying traveling once again.
      </p>

      <h2>London</h2>
      
      <p class="bridges">
        I love London! The food is great and little bit of everything. The neigborhoods are all diffrent and the shopping is incridible.
      </p>

      <h2>Ireland</h2>
      <p class="irish">
        I enjoy Ireland everytime I go, the people are amazing in and out of the city. It is one of the most beautiful scenic places. The city is very clean(except for St. Patrick Day) and the country side is green, and the clean is so refreshing.
      </p>
       
       <h2>New York</h2>
      
      <p class="nyc">
       What can I say about New York that hasn't been said. The art, the people, the food. Culturally diverse in all aspects, the city that never sleeps with diffrent neigborhoods is my absolute favorite. I love to get lost in this big city.
      </p>

      <h2>Seattle</h2>

      <p class="evergreen" >
        Seattle holds a special place in my heart. Its not my favorite, but it is unique. Intellgence is key in this city, bookstores and coffee shops on every corner. The music scence is multiple genres, the food is organic and drinks are cocoted from some magic in the air. You will fall in love with everything about Seattle.
