    <p class="stories">
      As a young girl in chicago, my parents had me in the car on the weekends
      going to farms in Indiana. we would pick out the ground my own veggies. We
      would also visit Howard & Sons to select our meats. I have fond bonding
      time with my mother,blancing and freezing veggies also butchering and
      portioning meats.

    <p class="young">
      So naturally I fell in love with food. My aunt and mom taught me how to
      cook. At the age of 11 I made Thanksgiving dinner for 13 adults. My
      proudest accomplishment at that age, I wanted to learn everything about
      food.

    <p class="military">
      In the 90's I graduated from high school and entered the military, the
      food was horrible. In 2001 my military time ended. I then worked as a
      resturant manager, once again it rekindled my passion for food.

      My sister approched me about attending culinary school and 2 months later
      we were Miami bound. Johnson & Wales is our alma mater, I then worked for
      Disney World as a cook. I worked in an open Kitchen, it was great seeing
      the faces of guest as they ate the food I made. I returned to Miami, once
      again an became a manager. 2007 we entered a recession. I fled to Seattle,
      where in learned all about beer & bourbon.
